Bot: Subject: Request for Leave from 4th June to 6th August

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request some time off from work. I would like to take a leave from 4th of June to 6th August. This will give me a much-needed break and allow me to recharge before returning to work.

I have reviewed our team's workload and ensured that all my tasks are up-to-date, so my absence should not impact the project's progress. I will make sure to complete all my pending work and ensure a smooth transition of tasks before my leave.

If there is any issue or concern regarding my request, please let me know as soon as possible so we can discuss alternative arrangements. I appreciate your understanding and approval for my leave.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
