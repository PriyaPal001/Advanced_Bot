1. The Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt) - Still standing, and the only one still intact.
2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Babylon, present-day Iraq) - A mysterious wonder, with no remaining evidence.
3. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) - A massive statue of the Greek god Zeus, destroyed in the 5th century AD.
4. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey) - A massive temple dedicated to the Greek goddess Artemis, destroyed by an earthquake in the 10th century BC.

1. The Great Wall of China
2. The Taj Mahal (India)
3. Machu Picchu (Peru)
4. Chichén Itzá (Mexico)
5. The Roman Colosseum (Italy)

User: 82329+8463/7452-734
Bot: A math problem!

To evaluate this expression, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 8463 by 7452: 8463 ÷ 7452 = 1.14
2. Multiply 82329 by the result: 82329 × 1.14 = 93832.26
3. Subtract 734 from the result: 93832.26 - 734 = 93198.26

So, the answer is: 93198.26

User: write a letter to my manager for leave from 25th December to 29th December with the reason of Christmas holiday
Bot: Here is the response:

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a few days off from work during the upcoming Christmas holiday season. I would like to take leave from December 25th to December 29th, inclusive.

As you know, Christmas is a special time for many people to spend with family and friends, recharge, and celebrate the joy of the season. It would be wonderful if I could join in on this celebration and come back to work feeling refreshed and revitalized.

I understand that this may be a busy period for our team, but I will ensure that all my tasks are completed before my leave and make arrangements for a smooth handover during my absence. If there's anything specific you would like me to focus on before taking the leave or if you have any concerns, please let me know.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
